# System Architecture

Our furniture e-commerce marketplace uses a modern, scalable architecture designed to provide a seamless experience for furniture shoppers while maintaining flexibility for future growth.

## Components

1. Frontend (Next.js)
   - Provides the user interface for the furniture marketplace
   - Handles client-side routing and rendering
   - Implements responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices

2. Sanity CMS
   - Acts as our content management system and primary database
   - Stores furniture product information, user data, and order details
   - Allows easy management of furniture catalog, including images, descriptions, and pricing

3. Third-Party APIs
   - Handle specialized functions like payment processing and shipment tracking for furniture deliveries

## System Interaction



1. Users interact with the Next.js frontend to browse and purchase furniture
2. The frontend fetches furniture data from Sanity CMS using its API
3. For specialized operations (e.g., payments, delivery tracking), the frontend communicates with third-party APIs
4. Order and user data are stored back in Sanity CMS

This architecture allows for a responsive user experience while leveraging the power of Sanity CMS for furniture content management and third-party services for specialized functions.
